    <h3 class="content-subhead">Relentless Excellence</h3>
    <p>My engagement comes from making life easier for humans. I firmly believe that the computer should do any job the
        computer can do so the humans are left with the jobs that are both most fulfilling for them and most uniquely
        suited to human capabilities.</p>

    <h3 class="content-subhead">Professional Background</h3>
    <p>Professionally my work has focused on desktop and process automation. I've made macros in Macro Express, VBA and
        general helper utilities rendered in JavaScript, TypeScript, VBScript and PowerShell to enable people to go home
        on time to be with their families, participate in their communities or even just go take a much-needed nap.
        These automations linked various applications connected by way of Citrix, directly on the desktop and run in the
        background to end goals of standardized formatting, researching and collating information for reporting and
        building consumer-facing, legal and business-compliant correspondences.</p>
    
    <h3 class="content-subhead">Personal Projects</h3>
    <p>I am a programmer by trade and by choice with hobby electronics and automation projects rendered in Python, PERL,
        C#, PowerShell, Java and anything else that looks interesting.</p>
